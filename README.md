Sure, here are some additional examples for each topic:

1. **Git Diff:** Suppose you want to compare the changes between the current commit and the previous commit. You can use `git diff HEAD~1..HEAD` to show the differences between the two.

2. **HEAD:** If you want to see the commit message and details of the current commit, you can use `git log HEAD` to display the information.

3. **Git Reset:** Let's say you made a mistake in your last commit and want to undo it. You can use `git reset HEAD~1` to undo the last commit and move your branch pointer to the previous commit.

4. **Git Rebase:** Suppose you have multiple commits in your branch and want to combine them into a single commit or modify the commit history. You can use `git rebase -i HEAD~3` to interactively rebase the last three commits.

5. **Git Fetch:** Suppose you want to download changes from a remote repository without merging them into your local repository. You can use `git fetch origin` to download the changes from the origin repository.

6. **Git Remote -v:** If you want to see a list of all remote repositories that your local repository is connected to, you can use `git remote -v` to display the list.

7. **Git Flow:** If you want to start working on a new feature called "my-new-feature", you can use `git flow feature start my-new-feature` to create a new feature branch based on the develop branch.

8. **Git Hooks:** Suppose you want to run a pre-commit hook that checks the syntax of your code before committing it. You can create a script called `my_pre-commit_hook.sh` and add it to your Git hooks directory. Then, you can use `git commit -m "my commit message" && my_pre-commit_hook.sh` to run the pre-commit hook before committing.

9. **Git LFS (Large File Storage):** Suppose you want to add a large image called "my-image.png" to your Git repository. You can use `git lfs track "*.png"` to track all PNG files, then use `git add my-image.png && git commit -m "add image"` to add the image to your repository using Git LFS.

10. **Git Subversion (SVN) Bridge:** Suppose you need to work with a legacy codebase that is stored in an SVN repository. You can use `git svn clone svn://example.com/my-project` to create a Git repository that is connected to the SVN repository.

11. **Git Bisect:** Suppose you have a bug in your code and want to find the specific commit that introduced the bug. You can use `git bisect start HEAD HEAD~10 && git bisect run my_test_script.sh` to perform a binary search through the last 10 commits and find the commit that introduced the bug.

12. **Git Worktree:** Suppose you want to work on a new feature branch called "my-feature-branch" without switching from your current branch. You can use `git worktree add ../my-feature-branch my-feature-branch` to create a new working directory for the feature branch and work on it simultaneously with your current branch.
